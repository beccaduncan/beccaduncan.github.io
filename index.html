            <p>What was your last party like? Friends? Socializing? Food? Adhering to a handbook to determine your every little action? Maybe not this last one, but for the noble class of Italy in the 18th century, this was more than common--it was expected.</p>
            <p>But these parties were not what we would consider a party by today’s standards.</p>
            <p>They were really day-long banquets where meals were separated by “dancing”-- or what we would now consider dancing. It gained the term “balleto” which was to describe the choreographed motions that occurred. Balleto became so pertinent to their society that the first instructors began their lessons for the nobility so that they would know the complex set of rules and motions needed to behave respectfully in society. According to the retired prima ballerina Darcy Bussell, there were rules governing attire, hem length, where to stand, and proximity to the king. </p>

                <p>The French loved the concept of balleto, but they decided that they would much rather watch people perform the complex movements on a raised platform than have to actually participate and do the motions themselves. So ballet -- as the French called it-- took the stage and thus began its evolution into the artform we recognize today.</p>

            <p class="floatright">During his reign, King Louis loved ballet so much that he viewed it as a necessary skill for all young noble boys to learn. Ballet master Ursula Hageli of the Royal Opera House in London reports that in his lifetime, King Louis performed 80 different roles in 40 ballets. The fact that he was king meant that he encouraged his subjects to do the same. I say encouraged, but you know how those monarchies worked. Thus, the first ballet school-- The Royal Academy of Ballet-- was created by the King in order for ballerinas to receive proper training.
                And this common set of training really revolutionized the performance aspect of ballet. As dancers were being consistently taught the same techniques and patterns for the first time, it became easier for the ballet masters to really hone in on the technique of these early ballerinas. </p>

            <p class="floatleft">The extreme success of these ballets performed in theater also encouraged other countries to create their own ballet companies. One country that really hit the ground running in ballet was Russia, who we can thank for classic works like The Nutcracker and Swan Lake. But as ballet spread, there became conflicts in the “right way” to do ballet and different technique methods formed. Today, we have 6 major ballet methods: the Balanchine Method, the French Method, the Vaganova Method, the Bournonville Method, the Royal Academy of Dance Method, and the Cecchetti Method.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="floatright">One of these ballerinas was Anna Pavlova. She was born in Russia, but was told that she was too gangly and ugly to ever be a successful ballerina. Rather than giving up, she went to Europe. At the time that Anna began performing, ballet was still very precise and articulate; however, she introduced a new concept into the art form: acting. Her emotional choreography and performances moved audiences in a way dance never had before, and this forever changed the face of the ballet world.</p>

            <p class="floatleft">In the 20th century, ballet became much more athletic. To be a ballerina, girls suddenly had to be strong and expressive but were still expected to be small and soft. These unrealistic expectations were short lived however because now in the 21st century ballerinas are allowed to look strong and powerful-- take Misty Copeland for example. She was told she was too muscular to be a ballerina, but she has become the first African-American prima ballerina and is a spokesperson for Under Armor.</p>
